# Introduction

This article summarizes the general guidelines & decisions made during the development of this project.

### Library

As the goal is to migrate multiple plugins from Vue to React ( IVT & Beehive for instance ), and as those plugins share multiple components & functionalities, creating a shared library would enhance reusability and help us achieve our goal faster.

You find on the library section all the components & hooks that have been created so far.

Once we are done with ivt, this library will be packaged and deployed to npm preparing to use it with Beehive project.

The library still depend on [@wpmudev/shared-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpmudev/shared-ui), at a later stage it will be replaced with the SUI React package that's currently under development.

### Ivt

Here you find docs for components and functionalites that are specific to ivt, The rule of thumb is to document only the parts that have potential use in multiple contexts.
